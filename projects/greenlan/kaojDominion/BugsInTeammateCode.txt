The bugs in my teammates code after testing the unit, cards, and random tests are:

There were no bugs reported in the Unit test section.

Smithy Card:
	Cards were not drawn from the correct pile and 3 cards were not drawn.
	The source of the problem is the drawCard function actually.
	This is found by line 562 of dominion.c
Adventurer Card:
	There was no issue reported
Village Card:
	There was no issue reported
Council_Room Card:
	There were not 4 cards drawn as expected
	There was a seg fault given so using gdb I was able to pinpoint the error.
	I changed the line for(i=0;i<=state->numPlayers;i++) to for(i=0;i<state->numPlayers;i++).
	This change had to occur for the test to finish running as it was trying to access a player that didnt exist.
	This error was in line 681 of dominion.c
Random Smithy Card:
	Cards were not drawn from the correct pile and 3 cards were not drawn.
	Occasionally the test for the other player hand unchanged failed but I could not find where that was happening.
	The source of the problem is the drawCard function actually.
	This is found by line 562 of dominion.c
Random Village Card:
	Occasionally the drawing cards from the correct pile test failed.
	I could not find the exact source but it is likely the same error in the draw card function as in other tests.
Random Adventurer Card:
	Occasionally the drawing cards from the correct pile test failed and taking 2 cards failed occasionally.
	I could not find the exact source but it is likely the same error in the draw card function as in other tests for the correct pile.
	For the taking two cards it seemed that the handcount was being calculated incorrectly in the adventurer code.
	This was in line 658 of dominion.c

All bugs were found by looking through the output file of the tests except the Council Room which was found at compile time.
